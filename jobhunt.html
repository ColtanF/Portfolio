        <h3>About</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            JobHunt is a branch from another, similar project I created (<a href="FITS.html">FITS</a>) that allows
            users to enter and save information for job postings that they find on various job listing 
            websites (Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.). I built this website because I wanted a tool that I could use 
            to help me keep track of jobs I found while searching for new job opportunities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            JobHunt was created with a lot of the same functionality that FITS already contained, 
            (basic CRUD app, item tracking), which is why it was a branch and not a completely new project. 
            However, over time, the project expanded well past the originally
            scope of FITS and became its own beautiful thing. JobHunt has a cleaner design, expanded functionality,
            and more fun JS/Python code that adds flavor to the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            In JobHunt, a user can add, edit, view, and delete job postings that they find online. JobHunt uses 
            the information that the user enters to create convenient links to information such as the company's 
            office location and the application site. A user can personalize their job postings by listing
            the experience requirements that they do and do not feel that they meet. They can also rate jobs that
            they add from 1-5 stars, and the top rated jobs will be displayed to the user on their home page.
        </p>
